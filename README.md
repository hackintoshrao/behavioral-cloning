# Behavioral-cloning
Convolutional Neural Network model which takes in pictures of a car track and its associated steering angles and train the model to predict the steering angles using camera images of the car to enable autonomous driving of the car on the track.

`model.py` - Contains the convolutional neural network model build using Keras.

`autonomous_drive.mp4` - Video of cars driving autonomously by predicting steering angles from the trained model.

`model_udacity_6.h5` - pre trained and saved model using Keras.
